Feature: MySql Connector
    In order to show you how to use Steeltoe for connecting to MySql
    You can run some MySql connection samples

    @netcoreapp3.1
    @win10-x64
    Scenario: MySql Connector for netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64
        When you run: cf create-service p.mysql db-small myMySqlService
        And you wait until CloudFoundry service myMySqlService is created
        And you run: dotnet publish -f netcoreapp3.1 -r win10-x64
        And you run in the background: cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/win10-x64/publish
        And you wait until CloudFoundry app mysql-connector is started
        When you get https://mysql-connector.x.y.z/Home/MySqlData
        Then you should see "Key 1 = Row1 Text"
        And you should see "Key 2 = Row2 Text"
